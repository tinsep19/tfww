[0m[32m[1mCreated and switched to workspace "test-1"![0m[32m

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.[0m

Changes to Outputs:
  [32m+[0m[0m output-1 = "input-1:first value"

You can apply this plan to save these new output values to the Terraform
state, without changing any real infrastructure.
